# 🤖 Chapter 14 — The AI Tech Stack: What You Should Know

## 1. Why This Chapter Exists

Artificial Intelligence isn’t a single tool — it’s an **ecosystem**. When people say they “work in AI,” that can mean anything from designing neural networks to building web apps powered by models in the cloud. This chapter gives you a **map of the AI landscape** so you know what’s out there, what each piece does, and how they all connect.

> 💡 Think of it like understanding the layers of a cake — from data collection at the bottom to fancy AI apps on top.

## 2. The Big Picture

AI systems usually have **five layers**, each with different technologies and roles:

| Layer                 | Purpose                        | Example Technologies                                    |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1️⃣ Data Layer        | Collect, clean, and store data | SQL, MongoDB, BigQuery, Snowflake                       |
| 2️⃣ Compute Layer     | Provide hardware power         | GPUs (NVIDIA), TPUs (Google), AWS EC2, Azure ML Compute |
| 3️⃣ Model Layer       | Train and serve AI models      | PyTorch, TensorFlow, Hugging Face, ONNX                 |
| 4️⃣ Deployment Layer  | Expose models as services      | FastAPI, Flask, Docker, Kubernetes                      |
| 5️⃣ Application Layer | Connect AI to users            | React, Streamlit, Gradio, LangChain, OpenAI API         |

These layers mirror the **flow of intelligence** — from raw data to user-facing smart features.

## 3. Data Layer — The Foundation

Before you can train any model, you need **clean, well-structured data**. Data engineering is the plumbing behind AI.

### Common Tools

* **Databases:** PostgreSQL, MongoDB, SQLite
* **Data lakes:** AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, Hadoop HDFS
* **ETL tools:** Airbyte, Apache Beam, dbt, Airflow
* **Data cleaning:** pandas, NumPy, PySpark

> 🧠 Analogy: The data layer is like your kitchen pantry — if it’s messy, your meals (models) will taste awful.

---

## 4. Compute Layer — The Engines

Training AI models is **computationally expensive**. You’ll often need specialised chips like **GPUs** or **TPUs** for parallel processing.

### Key Platforms

* **Local compute:** NVIDIA CUDA, PyTorch Lightning
* **Cloud platforms:** Google Colab, AWS Sagemaker, Azure ML, Paperspace
* **Distributed compute:** Ray, Dask, Horovod

> ⚙️ GPUs accelerate training by processing many operations simultaneously — like hiring 10,000 chefs instead of one to chop ingredients.

---

## 5. Model Layer — Where AI Happens

This is where the **learning** happens — designing, training, and tuning models.

### Core Frameworks

* **PyTorch** — popular among researchers, flexible and Pythonic
* **TensorFlow / Keras** — industry favourite, production-ready
* **JAX** — Google’s framework for fast and differentiable computation

### Pretrained Model Ecosystem

* **Hugging Face Transformers** — access to thousands of pre-trained models (BERT, GPT-2, T5, etc.)
* **OpenAI API** — large models like GPT-4 or DALL·E
* **Stability AI, Anthropic, Cohere** — alternative foundation model providers

> 💬 You don’t always train models from scratch. Often, you *fine-tune* an existing one, saving time and cost.

## 6. From LLMs to Agents — The New Evolution

AI models are evolving in how they interact and reason. Let’s break down the terms you’ll hear often:

### 🧠 Large Language Models (LLMs)

These are **text-based neural networks** trained on massive corpora to understand and generate human-like language.

* Examples: GPT-4, Claude, Gemini, LLaMA, Mistral.
* They respond to prompts but don’t have memory, planning, or tool use unless programmed externally.

> Analogy: An LLM is like a very smart parrot — excellent at language, but it only talks when prompted.

### 🤖 AI Agents

An **AI Agent** is an LLM connected to **tools and memory** — it can call APIs, browse data, or write files.

* Examples: LangChain agents, AutoGPT, or OpenAI’s Assistants API.
* They can reason over steps ("first get data, then analyse it") and act autonomously within boundaries.

> Analogy: An AI agent is like a virtual assistant who can *use* a computer — not just talk about it.

### 🧩 Agentic Systems

This term refers to **multi-agent ecosystems** where several agents collaborate, self-improve, and delegate tasks.

* Examples: swarm intelligence, role-based AI workflows, or systems like **CrewAI**.
* They often include memory persistence, long-term goals, and even emotional modelling.

> Analogy: Agentic AI is like a team of specialised virtual employees — researchers, coders, and managers — all working together.

### 7. Orchestration Frameworks and Libraries

These frameworks make it easier to build, connect, and manage agents or pipelines.

| Library | Focus | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| **LangGraph** | Multi-agent orchestration | Build graph-based workflows where agents pass messages to one another. |
| **LlamaIndex** | Data connectivity library | Connects LLMs to external data sources (like PDFs, databases, or APIs) for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). It helps the model *find* facts rather than hallucinate. |
| **LangChain** | Agent and tool orchestration library | Provides modular building blocks to let LLMs call functions, manage context, and chain reasoning steps. It’s the backbone for many AI assistants and chatbots. |
| **Semantic Kernel** | Microsoft orchestration library | Integrates planning, memory, and functions into cohesive AI workflows, especially within the .NET and Python ecosystems. |
| **MCP (Model Context Protocol)** | Open interoperability protocol | Unlike the above libraries, MCP isn’t a coding toolkit — it’s a *standard communication protocol* that lets AI models, tools, and data sources communicate securely and contextually across platforms. |
| **smolagents** | Lightweight agent framework/library | A minimal-abstraction Python library from Hugging Face that enables creating agents which write Python code or call tools, support for any LLM, tool-agnostic and model-agnostic. |

## 8. Platforms — Where Models Live and Run

You don’t always need to host models yourself. Many platforms provide **ready-to-run AI environments**.

| Platform                 | Description                                                                         |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Ollama**               | Run open-source LLMs locally (e.g. LLaMA, Mistral) with easy model management       |
| **AWS Bedrock**          | Unified API to access models from Anthropic, Stability AI, Cohere, and Amazon Titan |
| **Azure OpenAI Service** | Enterprise integration of GPT, DALL·E, and Codex                                    |
| **Google Vertex AI**     | End-to-end ML platform with model hosting, tuning, and pipelines                    |
| **Hugging Face Hub**     | Cloud for model storage, inference APIs, and community collaboration                |

> ☁️ These platforms act like *AI supermarkets* — you can browse, test, and deploy models without deep infrastructure setup.
